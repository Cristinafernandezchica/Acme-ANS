## Project Structure

For its development, **"Hello-World-25.1.0"** was used as a base, which is structured into three distinct layers:

- **Application tier**: Subdivided into two parts:  
  - **Application Server**: Hosts our applications. For this, we use **Tomcat**.  
  - **Application**: Implements all project functionalities, including design, development, and testing.  

- **Database tier**: Like the presentation tier, this consists of a single component: the **database server**. In our case, we use **MariaDB**.
